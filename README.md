# MNIST-Neural-Network-Matlab
Neural Network for MNIST Code for Matlab from scratch 
Hello World! Its Haseeb Jan student of AI, neural network and data science. it is my first project and i do all calculation and mathematics on my self to understand the magic of mathematics.

The story start from 
main.m
In which I call loadfile.m of labels and images for training and testing data sets. than I call nn.m
In nn.m the real shit is start in which I made a neural network of 784(size of input image=29x29) inputlayer nodes and 2 hidden layer 16 nodes each and output layer of 10 nodes.
than I call back propagation function in nn.m named backprop.m 
In this function I calculate the mean square error and back propagate by using the most simple concept.

This project is still in working stage so please don't use any awful or disappointing comment. Because this is my first week in AI.

Happy science and Thanks programming.
